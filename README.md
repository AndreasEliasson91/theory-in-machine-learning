# Theory in Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains my code to complete the course _Theory in Machine Learning_ at __Teknikhögskolan__.<br>
During the course we exercised two assignments in _Linear Algebra_ and _Data Analysis_, where __Python__ and a number of libraries where used.

## Dependencies
To install dependencies from the requirements-file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to unzip the _special_iris.zip_ in assignment02/data and keep it in that directory (the .csv-file it contains is too big to upload at GitHub).

## Assignments
The first assignment is to calculate and complete a couple of mathematical tasks, and also create functions to handle bigger calculations. 
The task contains calculations of matrices, vectors etc.<br>
The second assignment is to analyse data sets and answer questions about the results. The K-Means Algorithm is central to this assignment.
