# Assignment 01 - Theory in Machine Learning
This is the first assignment for the course _Theory in Machine Learning_<br>
The assignment is to complete six mathematical tasks using __Python__.<br>

# Tasks:
## 01
Solve this equation system: <br>
__x - 2y + 2z = 3<br>
-x + y + z = 4<br>
2x + 2y - 3z = -3<br><br>__

## 02
We have the following coordinates in a coordinate system:<br>
__P = (0, 0)<br>
Q = (2, 3)<br>
R = (8, 8)<br><br>__
- Calculate the distances _PQ_, _QR_ and plot them graphically.
- Create a function that takes just any number of distances and plots them graphically

## 03
We have the following vectors:<br>
__u = (1, 2, 3)<br>
v = (2, 2, 2)<br>
w = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1)<br>
x = (5, 6, 6, 5, 9)<br><br>__
- Calculate _u + v_ and _w + x_
- Create a function that takes just any number of vectors, in just any dimension, and calculates the sum

## 04
We have the following parallel vectors:<br>
__u = (0, 2, 3)<br>
v = (0, 4, 6)<br><br>__
- Calculate the scalar product _u·v_
- Create a function that takes two vectors, in just any dimension, and calculates their scalar product

## 05
We have the following matrices:<br>
__A = [[1, 2], [3, 2]]<br>
B = [[4, 5], [6, 5]]<br><br>__
- Calculate _A+B_
- Create a function that takes two matrices, with just any dimensions, and calculates the sum

## 06
We have the following matrices:<br>
__A = [[1, 2], [3, 2], [1, 3]] _2x3 matrix_<br>
B = [[4, 5, 6], [6, 5, 4]] _3x2 matrix_<br><br>__
- Calculate _AB_ and print the new matrix type (_mxn_)
- Create a function that takes two matrices, with just any dimensions, and calculates the product. Print the new matrix type or an error message if it's unmultiplable
